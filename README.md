## How to use
I envisioned this being useful for fan translators and fan adventure authors to use in their own projects without having to write a line of code. If you'd like to learn how to modify this, check the [wiki](https://github.com/Sharkalien/Godotstuck/wiki) for details on how rooms are set up and how to customize the player (wiki is currently a W.I.P.).

For a stripped down template, download the [Godotstuck repository](https://github.com/Sharkalien/Godotstuck) instead.
